In a convention, countries come together to discuss a global issue and reach a consensus about the procedures they should take in response. Unlike treaties, conventions are not necessarily legally binding, and they can act more as frameworks or concepts that do not include specific measures. Protocols are similar to treaties, but they generally amend, supplement, or clarify an agreement.","graph_title":"Multilateral Environmental Agreements","graph_type":"bar","show_line":true,"span_gaps":true,"precision":[{"decimals":0}],"previous":"12-3-1","next":"12-4-2","national_geographical_coverage":"Germany","page_content":"\n<span></span>","national_metadata_updated_date":"2021-07-16","national_data_updated_date":"2021-03-29","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2021-07-16: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/G205SDGs/sdg-data/commit/3283b3685c382437f9bcf429f695ac88d32bd5f3","national_data_update_url_text":"2021-03-29: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/G205SDGs/sdg-data/commit/0af2cf9a8fce7e3443706fcc13e227bce80c5de7","indicator":"12.4.1","language":"en","goal_meta_2_link_text":null,"goal_meta_3_link_text":null}
