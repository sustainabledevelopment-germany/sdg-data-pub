A fish stock of which abundance is at or greater than the level, that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable.","national_indicator_available":null,"national_indicator_periodicity":null,"national_geographical_coverage":null,"national_earliest_available_data":null,"admin_release_date":null,"admin_next_release":null,"admin_statistical_classification":null,"admin_contact_details":null,"computation_units":"Percentage (%)","computation_definitions":null,"computation_disaggregation":null,"comments_limitations":null,"un_designated_tier":"1","un_custodian_agency":"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)","goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-14-04-01.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata","source_active_1":false,"source_organisation_1":null,"source_periodicity_1":null,"source_earliest_available_1":null,"source_geographical_coverage_1":null,"source_url_1":null,"source_url_text_1":null,"source_release_date_1":null,"source_next_release_1":null,"source_statistical_classification_1":null,"source_active_2":false,"source_organisation_2":null,"source_periodicity_2":null,"source_earliest_available_2":null,"source_geographical_coverage_2":null,"source_url_2":null,"source_url_text_2":null,"source_release_date_2":null,"source_next_release_2":null,"source_statistical_classification_2":"l","source_contact_2":null,"source_active_3":false,"source_url_text_3":"Link to Source","source_active_4":false,"source_url_text_4":"Link to Source","source_active_5":false,"source_url_text_5":"Link to Source","reporting_status":"complete","published":true,"data_non_statistical":false,"graph_title":null,"graph_type":"line","national_data_update_url_text":"2018-11-28: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/G205SDGs/sdg-data/commit/c5373df0e44f42d288a4e1a4a5baa1cd29cf50c3","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2018-12-11: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/G205SDGs/sdg-data/commit/b0a999a311c94421cce6a877d73775048bd752a4","page_content":""}
